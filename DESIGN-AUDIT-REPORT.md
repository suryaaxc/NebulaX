## Executive Summary 

NebulaX v2 is a well-architected, visually polished astronomy platform. The design system foundations are strong (astronomy-authentic colors, glassmorphism, consistent typography). The main issues cluster into 5 themes:

1. **Broken/stale data** - Missing placeholder images, hardcoded 2025 astronomical dates serving wrong data in 2026, stale GCN circular IDs
2. **No onboarding** - Zero first-visit guidance on complex features (JWST, Kepler). Scientific jargon unexplained.
3. **Mobile gaps** - Canvas components lack touch support, hero iframe not responsive, 3 pages missing bottom nav padding
4. **Design token bypass** - 351 hardcoded hex colors across feature components instead of using the Tailwind theme
5. **Accessibility blockers** - Canvas visualizations are mouse-only, no `<main>` landmark, skip link target not focusable

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix immediately)

### BUG-01: Missing placeholder images (404s in production)
**File:** `src/services/nasa-images.ts:262-263`
`/images/loading-placeholder.svg` and `/images/error-placeholder.svg` referenced but don't exist on disk. Any component falling back to these shows a broken image.

### BUG-02: 2025 astronomical dates served as 2026 data
**File:** `src/services/real-time-events.ts:400-422`
Lunar events, eclipses, and planetary conjunctions are hardcoded for 2025 with naive year string-replace for other years. Users see astronomically incorrect dates for full moons, eclipses, and conjunctions in 2026.

### BUG-03: GCN proxy serving only fallback data
**File:** `src/app/api/proxy/gcn/route.ts:52`
Hardcoded `estimatedLatest = 43010` (from Dec 2025) means the proxy can't find current circulars and falls back to stale data. The real ID is likely 1000+ higher now.

### ACC-01: Canvas visualizations inaccessible
**Files:** `src/components/features/kepler/StarCanvas.tsx`, `src/components/features/observatory/ObservatoryCanvas.tsx`
Mouse-only interaction (onMouseMove, onClick). No keyboard navigation, no touch events, no screen reader access. WCAG 2.1 AA cannot be claimed for these pages.

### ACC-02: No `<main>` landmark + skip link broken
**File:** `src/app/layout.tsx`
The `#main-content` div is a `<div>`, not `<main>`. The skip link (`SkipToContent.tsx`) targets `#main-content` but divs aren't natively focusable - the skip link doesn't actually move focus.

---

## HIGH PRIORITY (Should fix soon)

### RESPONSIVE: Hero iframe not mobile-adapted
**File:** `src/components/features/landing/LandingHero.tsx:42`
`style={{ width: '75vw', height: '62vh' }}` with no breakpoints. Loads full Three.js + 11MB of planetary textures on mobile (pointer-events-none, so it's purely decorative). Replace with static image/poster on mobile.

### RESPONSIVE: 3 pages missing mobile bottom nav padding
**Files:** `src/app/kepler/page.tsx:47`, `src/app/jwst/page.tsx:47`, `src/app/observatory/page.tsx:54`
Height calc is `100vh - 64px` (header only). Mobile bottom nav is 64px. Content clipped behind it. Need `pb-16 lg:pb-0`.

### RESPONSIVE: Canvas components lack touch support
**Files:** `StarCanvas.tsx:196-211`, `ObservatoryCanvas.tsx:171-186`
Only mouse events. No touch handlers. Hit targets too small (14-18px vs 44px WCAG minimum).

### PERF: TypeScript/ESLint errors suppressed in build
**File:** `next.config.js:117-118`
`ignoreBuildErrors: true` and `ignoreDuringBuilds: true` mask potential runtime errors. Should be fixed and re-enabled.

### PERF: Canvas recomputes positions every frame (O(n^2))
**File:** `src/components/features/kepler/StarCanvas.tsx:82`
`computePositions()` runs inside every animation frame for 2,600+ stars. `stars.indexOf(s)` inside draw loop makes it O(n^2). Only needs recalculating on resize/view change.

### BUG-04: Sitemap missing major routes
**File:** `src/app/sitemap.ts`
Missing: `/jwst`, `/solar-system`, `/observatory`, `/mission-control`, `/credits`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/accessibility`. Two primary nav pages absent from sitemap.

### BUG-05: NASA API key exposed client-side
**File:** `src/services/real-time-events.ts:13`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_NASA_API_KEY` bundled into client JS. Should use server-side proxy like existing Kepler/ALeRCE proxies.

### SECURITY: Rate limiter defined but never wired
**File:** `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`
Rate limiting utility exists but no API route handler imports or uses it. All API routes are unprotected.

### SECURITY: CSP uses `unsafe-inline`
**File:** `src/middleware.ts`
Content Security Policy includes `unsafe-inline` for styles in production. Security headers also skip all API routes entirely.

---

## MEDIUM PRIORITY (Polish items)

### ONBOARD: Zero first-visit guidance
No onboarding tooltips, guided tours, or first-visit overlays anywhere. Users land on complex features (JWST 3-column viewer, Kepler spectral filters) with no explanation. Add dismissible intro panels stored in localStorage.

### CLARITY: Scientific jargon unexplained
| Term | Location | Fix |
|------|----------|-----|
| NIRCam, MIRI, NIRSpec, NIRISS | JWST filters | Expand on first use: "NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera)" |
| Cool M/K, Sun-like G, Hot F/A | Kepler filters | Add tooltip: "M and K type stars are cooler and redder" |
| HR Diagram | Kepler view mode | "HR Diagram (Star brightness vs temperature)" |
| Aitoff chart | Feature showcase | "All-sky projection map" |
| W/m^2 | Solar weather | Add unit label tooltip |

### CLARITY: "JWST" opaque in mobile nav
Mobile bottom nav shows "JWST" with no expansion. Change to "Webb" or "Webb Telescope".

### CLARITY: Mission Control hub missing 3 features
**File:** `src/app/mission-control/page.tsx`
Only shows Explore, Live Events, Observatory, Dashboard. Missing Solar System, Sky Map, Kepler, JWST from the hub tiles.

### CLARITY: "Modules" developer jargon
**File:** `src/components/features/landing/FeatureShowcase.tsx:65`
Section label "Modules" should be "Features" or "Experiences".

### BOLDER: Landing hero headline undersized
**File:** `src/components/features/landing/LandingHero.tsx:28`
H1 caps at `lg:text-5xl` (48px) for a full-viewport hero. Scale to `lg:text-6xl xl:text-7xl`. Subtitle at `text-xs sm:text-sm` is barely legible - increase to `sm:text-base`.

### BOLDER: Nebula glow overlays nearly invisible
**File:** `LandingHero.tsx:12`
Gold glow at `rgba(212,175,55,0.03)` - 3% opacity is imperceptible. Increase to 6-8%.

### QUIETER: FAB ping animation runs indefinitely
**File:** `src/components/ui/MissionControlFAB.tsx:89`
`animate-ping` with 3s duration pulses forever. Limit to 3-5 iterations then stop.

### CODE: 351 hardcoded hex colors bypass design system
Feature components use raw hex (`#0a0e1a`, `#d4af37`, `#4a90e2`) instead of Tailwind tokens. Create a shared `src/lib/design-tokens.ts` for canvas components.

### CODE: 3 files exceed 500 lines
| File | Lines | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| JWSTViewer.tsx | 948 | Split into Gallery, ImageViewer, FilterBar, useJWSTViewer hook |
| mast-api.ts | 2,453 | Move static observation data to JSON files |
| real-time-events.ts | 1,063 | Move static calendar data to `src/data/` |

### CODE: 5 duplicate utility functions
| Function | Copies | Files |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `formatCountdown()` | 3 | EventsTimeline, DashboardContent, LiveEventsWidget |
| `getEventIcon()` | 2 | events/page, EventsTimeline (different icons!) |
| `getSeverityColor()` | 2 | events/page, EventsTimeline (different signatures!) |
| `severityOrder` | 2 | real-time-events, LiveEventsBar |
| `mjdToDate()` | 2 | alerce/route, mast-api |

Extract to shared `src/lib/event-utils.ts` and `src/lib/astronomy-utils.ts`.

### BUG-06: Memory leak in PWAProvider
**File:** `src/components/PWAProvider.tsx:28-30`
`setInterval` created but interval ID never captured or cleared in useEffect cleanup.

### BUG-07: Kepler proxy has no fallback data
**File:** `src/app/api/proxy/kepler/route.ts:32-38`
Returns raw 502 when NASA TAP API is down. ALeRCE and GCN proxies handle this with fallback data.

### BUG-08: Stale rocket launch data
**File:** `src/services/real-time-events.ts:607-655`
Hardcoded 2025 launches (Artemis II, Europa Clipper). All in the past. Dead code.

## LOW PRIORITY (Nice to have)

- **PERF:** Starfield canvas runs continuous animation on all pages including data-heavy ones
- **PERF:** Dashboard hook triggers 7+ state updates on mount, UTC clock re-renders all children every second
- **PERF:** Canvas components don't check `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **POLISH:** PWA install prompt triggers immediately - add 30s delay or scroll-depth trigger
- **POLISH:** Solar System hero iframe has `pointer-events-none` but looks interactive - add visible CTA without hover
- **POLISH:** Privacy/Terms show "Last updated: Dec 7, 2025" - stale
- **POLISH:** Error pages (root, explore) should add troubleshooting tips like sky-map error page does
- **POLISH:** Nav item descriptions exist in data but never rendered as visible tooltips
- **CODE:** 5 production `console.log` statements (PWAProvider, WebVitals, Sentry)
- **CODE:** 15 `any` type usages (mostly Aladin Lite external library casts)
- **CODE:** `imoSlug` variable computed but never used in real-time-events.ts:673
- **CODE:** GA measurement ID hardcoded instead of env var
- **CODE:** Aladin Lite type declarations duplicated across 4 sky map components

---

## WHAT'S WORKING WELL

- **Design system foundations** - Astronomy-authentic color palette with real-science rationale. Glass panels, glow shadows, grain textures create a cohesive telescope aesthetic.
- **Error boundaries** - Every major route has a custom error page with contextual recovery options. Sky Map error includes troubleshooting steps.
- **Loading states** - Thematic loading messages ("Acquiring signal...", "Reading sensors..."). Full skeleton UIs for Sky Map and Explore.
- **Service worker caching** - Tiered strategy (CacheFirst for assets, NetworkFirst for APIs) with appropriate TTLs.
- **Dynamic imports** - All heavy components (Three.js, Leaflet, Aladin) are properly lazy-loaded with SSR disabled.
- **Font loading** - display:swap on all 3 fonts prevents FOIT.
- **Image optimization** - AVIF/WebP formats, NASA image proxy with retry, proper fallback chains.
- **Viewport config** - `userScalable: true`, `maximumScale: 5`, `viewportFit: cover` - all correct.
- **Safe area support** - Notched device padding on mobile bottom nav.
- **Accessibility infrastructure** - Focus rings, reduced motion in CSS, live announcer region, skip link (needs fix), high contrast overrides.
- **Data-dense page restraint** - Kepler and Observatory viewers show excellent visual discipline. Chrome stays out of the way.
